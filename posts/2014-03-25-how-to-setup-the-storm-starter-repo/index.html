<div class="markdown">
<p>Just today, I have faced an issue which took up (wasted) several hours of my
time in a rather painful way, so I thought I should share my findings so that
others do not repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p>I was learning <a href="http://storm.incubator.apache.org/">Storm</a> and one of
the resources I found was the <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter">storm-starter</a>
repository. While I was disappointed that there were no instructions for setup
using Leiningen (other than a one-liner pointing to the Leiningen repo,
more on this towards the end of this article), I proceeded to set up Maven,
and ran the <code>WordCountTopology</code> using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mvn compile exec:java -Dstorm.topology<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>storm.starter.WordCountTopology
</code></pre></div><p>however, this was met with rather cryptic error messages from Maven (which I
shall omit here due to my frustration earlier today) and it took
me literally hours of googling, trying the command and variations of the
command at both the root directory of the repo and the <code>examples/storm-starter</code>
directory, appending those directories to <code>CLASSPATH</code>, all of which did not get
me any closer to solving the problem.</p>
<p>It turns out that the solution is simple. Instead of using the above
storm-starter repository,
use <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-starter">this one</a> instead, and follow
the same instructions. One thing to take note of is that in this repository,
the <code>pom.xml</code> file is named <code>m2-pom.xml</code> . So to execute the WordCountTopology
code, you will run the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mvn -f m2-pom.xml compile exec:java -Dstorm.topology<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>storm.starter.WordCountTopology
</code></pre></div><p>A kind reader, Jorge Plaza, has pointed out that the following series of
commands will work too (Thank you Jorge!). If you can&rsquo;t run the
WordCountTopology with the above command, these should do the trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mvn -f m2-pom.xml clean
mvn -f m2-pom.xml package
storm jar target/storm-starter-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar storm.starter.WordCountTopology
</code></pre></div><p><strong>A note of caution:</strong> this make use of the
<a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/wiki/Command-line-client">storm client</a> and
if you&rsquo;ve set up the Storm client to deploy to a production server, that is what
the <code>storm jar</code> command will do. However, if you&rsquo;ve not set up the Storm client
to deploy to a production server, the <code>storm jar</code> command will run the
WordCountTopology on your local machine.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder why the repository was moved in the first place. Worse, the
documentation is not up to date. I don&rsquo;t mean to criticize anyone, but I
personally believe that documentation to do with setting things up should be
accurate, especially for a repository like this which is meant for someone new
to Storm. Not exactly the best welcome party.</p>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/54">this pull request</a>,
it seems that Leiningen cannot be used to set up the storm-starter repository.</p>
<p>I have a few more blog posts queueing up (for quite some time), but I decided
to work on this one because it&rsquo;ll be a very quick write up, and the issue
described here caused me a lot of frustration.</p>
